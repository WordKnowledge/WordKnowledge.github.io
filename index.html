    <p>How many words do you know in English or another language? You can get a rough idea by filling the form below,
      using word and page counts from a dictionary. Insofar as the resulting estimate is realistic, it will actually
      be an estimate of how many words you know from that dictionary, of course! To estimate the number of words you
      know in a LANGUAGE, you would need an unabridged dictionary supplemented with lists of words that probably would
      not be in a dictionary, such as proper names that you know that come from places where the language you are
      testing is not the language of the communities.</p>
